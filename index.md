The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users
have been alive. It has survived because it's a powerful tool that
allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just
 a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive
 tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.

Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing
tasks, including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce
you to this powerful tool.
